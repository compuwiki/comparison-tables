| First Release / Lineage     | First release in 2008. Based on Linux. Typically bundled with Google services. Google-free forks include FireOS, LineageOS, or GrapheneOS. | First release in 1991. Typically bundled with GNU software. Various distributions exist, e.g. OpenSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, and Arch. | First release in 2007. Based on Darwin (like macOS), hence lineage going back to the original UNIX from 1971. | First release in 1985. Early versions were based on MS-DOS (1981-2000). Current versions ("NT") started as a fork of OS/2 (1987-2001). | Early versions (1984-2002) were an independent OS. Now based on Darwin (Mach, BSD, and NeXTSTEP code), hence lineage going back to the original UNIX from 1971. | First release in 1993. Forked from the Berkeley Software Distribution (1978-1995). Lineage going back to the original UNIX from 1971. Various derivatives e.g. GhostBSD and HardenedBSD |
